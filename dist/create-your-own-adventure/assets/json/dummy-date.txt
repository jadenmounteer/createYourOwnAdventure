Making Breakfast

A gripping tale of waking up hungry.

You get up one morning and wince in pain as your stomach rumbles.

You muster the energy you can to walk to the kitchen. As your eyes begin to lose focus you take a look at your surroundings. You see the fridge and the pantry.

A rush of bright light fills the dark kitchen as you open the fridge. You feel your mind begin to go fuzzy and your hunger increases. This is going to be close. You see some milk and eggs.

You thrust open the pantry door as your empty stomach rumbles once again. You see some Captain Crunch. You decide to take it. If only you had some milk?

As you turn to the fridge your legs give out as the last of your energy seeps from your starving body. You hardly feel the floor as you fall. As the darkness creeps in your only thought is that you should have been faster. But you were too late...to eat the most important meal of the day...

You grab the milk as your stomach rumbles. Your vision begins to go fuzzy but you manage to chug a bit of milk which gives you the energy you need. Hopefully no one saw that you drank straight from the carton...About to fall over from lack of calories, you open the pantry door and find captain crunch. In a nearby drawer you find a bowl and a spoon. As you poor in the life-saving liquid and crunchy deliciousness relief washes over you. You are going to make it! You lift the spoon to your lips and manage a smile as you mutter "Crunchatize me Captain..." and you spend the rest of your morning enjoying your bowl of cereal.
